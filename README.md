# SDL-Audio-Player
A basic, single-header implementation of a WAV file audio player in SDL2. The player can play both sound effect files and music tracks.
**Note: As far as I'm aware, SDL Mixer is only compatible with sound files saved in the 16-bit WAV format.** If your file is not saved in that format, it may not play correctly.
